# Robotic_Legs_StickModel
Stick figures are the simplest way to demonstrate a robot's mechanism. The model aims to identify the appropriate angle at which the robot should maintain stability.
## Designing the Stick Model
For this design, the height of the robot could not exceed 64 cm. To begin with, we created foot assemblies in the size of 28 cm by 4 cm by 12 cm by using the cube.
Then, create two cylinders with dimensions of r=6cm and h=12cm to assemble the robot's joint. A cube with the following dimensions has been used for the Hip: x=12.29 cm, y=8 cm, and z=30.45 cm. Finally, the legs are constructed using three different cylinders.
## Finding The angle 
To make the robot more dynamic, bones have been introduced to the design to find the appropriate angel. Therefore, the feet will cover 4.5 cm and the angle is 4.594
